# Hi there, I'm Quan

Welcome to my corner of GitHub!

Here, you'll find a wild collection of code experiments, unfinished projects and the occasional stroke of genius.

## What I Do

- Write code. Break code. Fix code (maybe).
- Pretend to understand documentation.
- Google errors like a pro.

## Random Personal Projects

None.

## Some Facts

- Can recite "Hello World" in 6 languages (including Vietnamese and English).
- My code compiles 60% of the time, every time.
- I once fixed a bug by turning my computer off and on again (real).
